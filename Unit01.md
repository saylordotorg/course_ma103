**Unit 1: Vectors and Matrices** <span id="1"></span> 
*This unit begins with a discussion of vectors and vector algebra.  You
will study and then be able to define the geometric properties of the
dot product and the cross product.  You will learn vector algebra, which
will allow you to perform operations on vectors themselves and not just
their coordinates.  This will help you understand the geometric
significance of the operations and computations performed.  You will
then learn about parameterizations of lines and planes using vector
algebra and geometry.  This way of thinking, i.e. going back and forth
between algebra and geometry, will be very important for the rest of the
course.  Finally, this unit introduces fundamental concepts of velocity
and acceleration using vectors; this will allow us to study these
concepts in their natural form. *

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**
