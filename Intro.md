Multivariable Calculus is an expansion of Single-Variable Calculus in
that it extends single variable calculus to higher dimensions.  You may
find that these courses share many of the same basic concepts, and that
Multivariable Calculus will simply extend your knowledge of functions to
functions of several variables.  The transition from single variable
relationships to many variable relationships is not as simple as it may
seem; you will find that multi-variable functions, in some cases, will
yield counter-intuitive results. The structure of this course very much
resembles the structure of Single-Variable Calculus I and II.  We will
begin by taking a fresh look at limits and continuity.  With functions
of many variables, you can approach a limit from many different
directions.  We will then move on to derivatives and the process by
which we generalize them to higher dimensions.  Finally, we will look at
multiple integrals, or integration over regions of space as opposed to
intervals. The goal of Multivariable Calculus is to provide you with the
tools you need to handle problems with several parameters and functions
of several variables and to apply your knowledge of their behavior.  But
a more important goal is to gain a geometrical understanding of what the
tools and computations mean.

### Course Requirements

In order to take this course, you must:  
  
 √    Have a computer.  
  
 √    Have continuous broadband Internet access.  
  
 √    Have the ability/permission to install plug-ins or software (e.g.,
Adobe Reader or Flash).  
  
 √    Have the ability to download and save files and documents to a
computer.  
  
 √    Have the ability to open Microsoft files and documents (.doc,
.ppt., .xls, etc.).  
  
 √    Have competency in the English language.  
  
 √    Have read the [Saylor Student
Handbook.](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Saylor-StudentHandbook.pdf)  
  
 √    Have completed the following courses from [“The Core
Program”](http://www.saylor.org/majors/mathematics/) of the mathematics
discipline: [MA101 Single-Variable Calculus
I](http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma101/) and [MA102 Single-Variable
Calculus II](http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma102/).

### Course Information

Welcome to MA103.  Below, please find general information on the course
and its requirements.

**Primary Resources**: This course is comprised of the following primary
materials:

-   East Tennessee State University: Jeff Knisley’s [*Multivariable
    Calculus Online*](http://math.etsu.edu/multicalc/prealpha/index.htm)
-   Brigham Young University: Kenneth Kuttler’s [*Calculus, Applications
    and Theory*](http://www.math.byu.edu/~klkuttle/)
-   MIT: Denis Auroux’s “Multivariable Calculus” [Video
    Lectures](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-02-multivariable-calculus-fall-2007/video-lectures/) and
    [Lecture
    Notes](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-02-multivariable-calculus-fall-2007/lecture-notes/)

**Requirements for Completion**: In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
You will also need to complete the following:

            - Unit 1 Assignment: Exercise Sets  
             - Unit 2 Assignment: Exercise Sets  
             - Unit 3 Assignment: Exercise Sets  
             - Unit 4 Assignment: Exercise Sets  
             - The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
 However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the exercise sets listed above.  In order to “pass” this
course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on the Final Exam.  Your
score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you complete it.  If you
do not pass the exam, you may take it again. 

**Time Commitment**: This course should take you a total of **88.5
hours** to complete.  This is only an approximation and may take longer
to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the amount
of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These should help
you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a look at
these time advisories and to determine how much time you have over the
next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you about 22 hours to
complete.  Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to
complete subunit 1.1 (a total of 7 hours) over three days, for example
by completing sub-subunit 1.1.1 (a total of 2 hours) on Monday;
sub-subunit 1.1.2 (a total of 1 hour) and about half of sub-subunit
1.1.3 (about 2 hours) on Tuesday; the rest of sub-subunit 1.1.3 (about 2
hours) on Wednesday; etc.

**Tips/Suggestions**: As noted in the “Course Requirements,”
Single-Variable Calculus is a pre-requisite for this course.  If you are
struggling with the material as you progress through this course,
consider taking a break to revisit [MA101 Single Variable Calculus
I](http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma101/) and [MA102 Single Variable
Calculus II](http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma102/).  It will likely be
helpful to have a graphing calculator on hand for this course.  If you
do not own or have access to one, consider using this [free graphing
calculator](http://www.calculateforfree.com/graph.html).  As you read,
take careful notes on a separate sheet of paper.  Mark down any
important equations, formulas, and definitions that stand out to you.
 It will be useful to use these notes as a review prior to completing
the Final Exam.
