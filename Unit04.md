**Unit 4: Triple Integrals and Surface Integrals in 3-Dimensional
Space** <span id="4"></span> 
*One common misconception of multiple integrals is that the primary
difference is the units of the output of our integration.  When we used
single integrals, our output was area; when we worked with double
integrals, our output was volume.  It may be natural to assume that
triple integrals give an output of whatever comes next, but this is not
the case.  The true variation between multiple integrals is not the
output, or even the function, but the domain of integration.  Single
integrals are evaluated over an interval, whereas double integrals are
evaluated over a planar region. Triple integrals are similar to other
integrals in most regards, but they are evaluated over a 3-dimensional
region.*  
    
 *After learning about the basics of triple integrals, you will learn
about The Divergence Theorem.  As with Green's Theorem, the Divergence
Theorem is a special case of the more generalized Stokes' Theorem that
we will see later in this unit.  The Divergence Theorem states that the
flux of a vector field is equivalent to the volume integral of the
divergence of the specified region. Essentially, this proves that the
net flow leaving our region is equal to the total amount of sources
(minus sinks) in our region.  This brings us to Stokes’ Theorem, which
generalizes one of the most important theorems in Calculus, the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.  Stokes’ Theorem defines a relationship
between the integration of various differential forms over manifolds in
multiple dimensions.*  
    
 *Finally, you will learn a little about Maxwell's Equations.  They are
a set of four different partial differential equations: Gauss' Law,
Gauss' Law for Magnetism, Faraday's Law, and Ampère's Law with Maxwell's
Correction.  Each equation defines a relationship between electric
fields, magnetic fields, density, and various other important
mathematical parameters.*
